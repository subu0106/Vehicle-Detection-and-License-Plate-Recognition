# Vehicle Detection and License Plate Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting vehicles and recognizing license plates using advanced computer vision techniques. The system is designed to accurately identify and extract license plates from images or video streams, followed by recognition of the characters on the plate. The project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for vehicle detection and Tesseract OCR for analyzing and extracting text from the license plates.

## Features
- **Vehicle Detection:** Identifies and localizes vehicles in images or video streams using the YOLO model.
- **License Plate Detection:** Extracts the region of interest (ROI) containing the license plate from detected vehicles.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Recognizes and extracts text from the detected license plates using Tesseract OCR.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV:** Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** A state-of-the-art object detection model used for detecting vehicles.
- **Tesseract OCR:** An open-source OCR engine used for recognizing and extracting text from license plates.
<!-- - **TensorFlow/Keras:** (Optional) Used if any additional machine learning models are integrated. -->
